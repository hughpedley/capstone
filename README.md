# capstone
A collection of work I've done as of now on my CS1980 Capstone project


The apps with 'thread' in the title, server, and client are all pieces of practice assigned to me to get more familiarity with required concepts.

"Leader" and "Follower" are the two apps actually required of me to make for the project.
